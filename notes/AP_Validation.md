## Unit Tests
_This section will describe the purpose, scope, and procedure relating to the autopilot unit tests._

**Purpose**

Unit tests are conducted to ensure:
1. All PWM input commands given by the autopilot are within an acceptable range and will not damage the physical servos.
2. Autopilot state rejection performs as expected.
3. Input commands calculated by the autopilot are in the expected direction.

These tasks are achieved by intercepting the states observed by the 5-hole probe and INS and replacing them with a set of test states. In total, 21 states are tested. The expected inputs are based on optimal controller simulation. The test points include:
1. Rejection of too negative state
  - *Expected behavior:* All state variables rejected. Replaced by last known good state (trim state)
  - *Expected input:* Trim input on all input axes.
2. Rejection of too large state

  - *Expected input:* Trim input on all input axes.

21. Trim condition

  - *Expected input:* Trim input on all input axes.

**Scope**

These tests are conducted on single axis states only. They will not ensure proper functionality on multi-axis state inputs. These tests cannot verify that the control surfaces deflect in the proper direction, only that the proper directional command is sent to them based on the standard deflection directions. It is up to the user to confirm proper directional calibration of control surfaces by verifying expected behavior.

**Procedure**

- In terminal `make clean`
- In terminal `git clean -fxd`
- In terminal `make debug`
- In terminal `sudo ./run.sh`
  - When autopilot module is loaded the text "WARNING: AUTOPILOT STARTED IN DEBUGGING MODE. DO NOT FLY." will appear
- In terminal `pwm arm`
- On TX, SC3 to AP
- 21 tests will run. Displayed will be test number, state input, and AP inputs. Control surfaces will deflect. To ensure proper control surface deflection direction, watch each surface and ensure it moves as excepted. Figure 1 provides control surface and body axes definitions. The program will automatically check as well.
- A new test will run every 7 seconds
- When all 21 tests are passed, in terminal `pwm disarm`
- In terminal `all exit`
- In terminal `sudo poweroff`

## Calibration Check
_This section will describe the purpose, scope, and procedure relating to the autopilot calibration check._

**Purpose**

The purpose of this test is to ensure that the control surfaces adhere to deflection commands sent by autopilot, both in magnitude and direction. This verifies proper PWM conversion and calibration in the AP module.

**Scope**

This test does not check AP command generation. All commands sent during the test are artificially generated. This test only investigates PWM calibration curves.

**Procedure**

- Attach 3ft radius protractor to left aileron.
- In terminal `make clean`
- In terminal `git clean -fxd`
- In terminal `make ail_cc`
- In terminal `sudo ./run.sh`
- In terminal `pwm arm`
- On TX, SC3 to manual
- Adjust 3ft radius protractor so that the deflection reads 0 deg.
- Move TX aileron stick all the up left and right. Ensure that the protractor needle does not scrape the radius at any point. If it does, adjust accordingly.
- In terminal `pwm disarm`
- In terminal `all exit`
- In terminal `sudo ./run.sh`
  - When autopilot module is loaded the text "WARNING: AUTOPILOT STARTED IN CALIBRATION CHECK. DO NOT FLY." will appear
- In terminal `pwm arm`
- On TX, SC3 to AP
- Angular tests will run in 15 second intervals. Each test will display the expected deflection angle. Compare the expected deflection to the actual deflection as measured by the 3ft radius protractor. Deflection directions are determined by Figure 1.
- When all 5 angles are complete, in terminal `pwm disarm`
- In terminal `all exit`
- Repeat all above steps elevator and rudder control surfaces.
  - `make ele_cc`
  - `make rud_cc`
